# 🧱 Grafito — Simple GraphQL Client for Go

Grafito is a lightweight and expressive GraphQL client for Go (Golang), designed for developers who want a **clean, composable, and type-safe** way to interact with GraphQL APIs — without code generation or heavy dependencies.

> 💡 Inspired by the simplicity of `net/http` and the readability of GraphQL itself.
